Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is abranch of computer science used for developing and maintaining software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Precise;The work flow in writing the source codes should be short and a functional one.
Scalabilit;The system developed should be able to be increased without effect on performance.
Security; implematation of authorisation and use of encription.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Problem definition-identify the problem ,whom it affects and its purpose
Problem anaylsis-identification of user specification
Design-having the framework
Coding-converting source code into object code\
Testing-identify if debugging is required
Documentation
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer develops applications,programs and systems using programming languages.Also maintains and updates softwares.
quality assuarance engineer;does acollaborations with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
project manager;leads and assembles the software team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Time constrains;software engineers shoukd adopt agile methodologies
Rapid technological advancement;softwares should adopt continuous learning practises


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing
intergration tests
system tests


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Improved user experience ; Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
developer control ; Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
